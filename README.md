# 🍕 Quick Commerce | The Secret Oven

A modern Progressive Web App (PWA) for food ordering, built using **React** and **Next.js**.  
This demo showcases a responsive frontend interface with dummy hardcoded data to simulate a real-world food delivery experience.

💡 For best experience (since it's a PWA), if you're using a laptop or desktop, open DevTools and toggle between devices to simulate mobile views.
